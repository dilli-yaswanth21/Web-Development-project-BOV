      <p class="center-align"> The Eiffel Tower is one of the most iconic landmarks in the world and a symbol of Paris, France. It is a wrought-iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars, a large public greenspace in the heart of the city. Named after its engineer Gustave Eiffel, the tower was completed in 1889 and has since become a global cultural icon and a marvel of engineering..
        Construction: The tower was built as the entrance arch to the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair) held in Paris to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution. Construction began in 1887 and was completed in just over two years.

Design and Height: The Eiffel Tower stands at a height of 330 meters (1,083 feet), making it the tallest man-made structure in Paris until the completion of the Tour Montparnasse in 1973. It consists of an iron framework made up of lattice girders, giving it a distinctive and intricate appearance.

Architectural Style: The tower reflects the architectural style known as "exhibition architecture," which was prominent during the 19th century. It was designed by the engineers Maurice Koechlin and Émile Nouguier, and the architect Stephen Sauvestre, who added the decorative arches and the glass pavilion at the top.

Observation Decks: The Eiffel Tower has three observation decks located at different heights. Visitors can ascend to these decks via elevators or stairs. The first and second levels house restaurants, souvenir shops, and exhibition spaces. The topmost level offers breathtaking panoramic views of Paris.

Visitor Experience:<br>The Eiffel Tower welcomes millions of visitors each year. Climbing the tower offers spectacular views of the cityscape, including landmarks like the River Seine, the Champs-Élysées, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. The tower is also beautifully illuminated at night, making it a popular attraction after sunset.

Symbolic Importance: The Eiffel Tower has come to symbolize Paris and is often associated with romance, elegance, and the city's artistic and cultural heritage. It has been featured in numerous films, literature, and artworks, becoming an enduring emblem of France and a representation of human achievement.

Maintenance and Renovations: Over the years, the Eiffel Tower has undergone regular maintenance and renovations to ensure its structural integrity and enhance visitor experience. The tower's appearance has evolved, including changes in its paint color. It was initially reddish-brown and is currently painted in a shade known as "Eiffel Tower Brown."
